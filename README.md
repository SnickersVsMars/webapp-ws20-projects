## Task description
This project is designed to let us practice our project management skills with scrum as well as our software development skills in a team. <br>
We will have 3 scrum sprints. Each sprint we are presented with user stories. <br>
From the user stories our team has to choose which ones to implement in the following sprint. <br>
Additionally we have to test our implementation as well as the implementation of another group. <br>
At the end of each sprint every group presents the results from another group.

## Project goal
FH JOANNEUM will introduce a new project management tool. <br>
With this tool, users should have the possibility to view and search for information. <br>
Our group is assigned to manage and display information regarding ongoing or finished projects.

## Technology
Our used technologies are:  
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Bootstrap as an additional Framework
