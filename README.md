## Task description

This project is designed to let us practice our project management skills with scrum as well as our software development skills in a team.  
We will have 3 scrum sprints. Each sprint we are presented with user stories.  
From the user stories our team has to choose which ones to implement in the following sprint.  
Additionally we have to test our implementation as well as the implementation of another group.  
At the end of each sprint every group presents the results from another group.

## Project goal

FH JOANNEUM will introduce a new project management tool.  
With this tool, users should have the possibility to view and search for information.  
Our group is assigned to manage and display information regarding ongoing or finished projects.
